## 2. Development Log

### **v7.4 (18 Oct 2025): The `datetime.now()` Fix**

-   **Problem:** An `AttributeError: module 'datetime' has no attribute 'now'` was reported in the "Moraselaty Campaigns" section. The error was caused by an incorrect call to the `datetime` library.
-   **Investigation:** A project-wide search (`grep`) revealed 16 instances where `datetime.now()` was used instead of the correct `datetime.datetime.now()`. This was a recurring issue that needed a definitive fix.
-   **Solution:** A global find-and-replace was performed to change all occurrences of `datetime.datetime.now().datetime.now()` (a result of a previous faulty fix) and `datetime.now()` to the correct `datetime.datetime.now()`.
-   **Key Takeaway:** When fixing a recurring error, perform a global search to eradicate all instances of the bug. A partial fix will only lead to future failures.

### **v7.2 & v7.3 (16-17 Oct 2025): Fixing the Pricing Planner**

-   **Problem:** The newly created "Pricing Planner" had two major issues: 1) The product dropdown was empty. 2) It was loading the wrong list of campaigns.
-   **Investigation:**
    1.  **Product List:** The code was not reading from any product database. The user provided an Excel file (`Bo22ok1.xlsx`) with all products and prices.
    2.  **Campaign List:** The `load_campaigns()` function was hardcoded to read from `moraselaty_campaigns.json` instead of `campaign_plans.json`, which is where the "Campaign Planner" saves its data.
-   **Solution:**
    1.  The Excel file was converted into a structured `products_pricing.json` file.
    2.  The `pricing_planning.py` module was updated to:
        -   Load the product list from `products_pricing.json`.
        -   Automatically fill the base price when a product is selected.
        -   Change the `load_campaigns()` function to read from `campaign_plans.json` and filter for only active, non-deleted campaigns.
-   **Key Takeaway:** Features must be integrated with the correct data sources. Hardcoded paths or assumptions about data locations lead to brittle code.

### **v7.0 (15 Oct 2025): Deployment & Git Challenges**

-   **Problem:** After implementing the Pricing Planner, the new feature was not visible in the user's deployed Streamlit Cloud application, despite the code being correct in the development environment.
-   **Investigation:** The root cause was a misunderstanding of the deployment workflow. Changes made in the local sandbox are not automatically reflected in the production app. They must be pushed to the linked GitHub repository first.
-   **Solution:**
    1.  Guided the user on how to use `git` to `add`, `commit`, and `push` changes.
    2.  When authentication failed, guided the user to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).
    3.  Used the PAT to successfully push the updates to the `main` branch.
    4.  Resolved several `git pull` conflicts caused by divergent histories between the local and remote repositories.
-   **Key Takeaway:** The development-to-production workflow is critical. **Code -> Test -> Commit -> Push -> Deploy.** Any AI assistant must understand this cycle and be prepared to guide the user through it.

### **v6.0 & v6.1 (14 Oct 2025): Data Persistence & The Recurring `inventory_files` Bug**

-   **Problem:** The user reported losing all their data (campaigns, etc.) with every update. A related `UnboundLocalError` also kept appearing in the admin dashboard, related to the `inventory_files` directory.
-   **Investigation:** Both issues stemmed from the ephemeral nature of the sandbox environment. The `inventory_files` directory and all other data files were being deleted upon every restart.
-   **Solution:**
    1.  **Data Loss:** Implemented a "Backup & Restore" feature directly in the admin dashboard. This feature uses a helper script (`backup_utility.py`) to create a ZIP archive of all critical JSON files, which the user can download and re-upload after an update.
    2.  **`inventory_files` Bug:** The definitive fix was to add `os.makedirs("inventory_files", exist_ok=True)` at the beginning of the `admin_dashboard()` function. This ensures the directory is *always* created before it is accessed, completely eliminating the error.
-   **Key Takeaway:** Never assume a file or directory exists in an ephemeral environment. Always create it defensively (`exist_ok=True`). Provide users with a mechanism to persist their data across sessions.

### **v5.8 & v5.9 (13 Oct 2025): State Management & Scope Issues**

-   **Problem:** Two critical errors appeared: an `UnboundLocalError` in `create_moraselaty_campaign` and an `AttributeError` when saving an AI-generated marketing campaign.
-   **Investigation:** Both errors were caused by issues with variable scope and Streamlit's execution model.
    1.  **UnboundLocalError:** `min_price` and `max_price` were defined inside an `if` block but used later, outside of it.
    2.  **AttributeError:** Campaign data (like `selected_products`, `campaign_idea`) was defined within a tab, but the "Save" button was outside the tab. When the button was pressed, Streamlit re-ran the script, and the variables were no longer in scope.
-   **Solution:**
    1.  Initialized `min_price` and `max_price` to `0.0` at the top of the function.
    2.  Used `st.session_state` to store the campaign data. When the data was generated, it was saved to `st.session_state.campaign_data`. The "Save" button then read the data from the session state, which persists across script re-runs.
-   **Key Takeaway:** `st.session_state` is the primary tool for managing state in Streamlit. Use it to pass data between different parts of the UI and to persist information across user interactions and script re-runs.
