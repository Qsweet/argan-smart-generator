## üöÄ Getting Started

### For AI Assistants (like Manus AI)

1. **Read** `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` first
2. **Study** `CODE_STRUCTURE.md` to understand the codebase
3. **Review** `DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md` to learn from past work
4. **Follow** the workflow in `AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md`
5. **Reference** `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` as needed

### For Human Developers

1. Start with `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
2. Dive into `CODE_STRUCTURE.md` for technical details
3. Check `DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md` before making changes
4. Use `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for common tasks

---

## üîÑ Keeping Documentation Updated

**Critical Rule:** After every significant change, bug fix, or new feature:

1. Update `DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md` with the details
2. If the change affects architecture, update `CODE_STRUCTURE.md`
3. If new files or patterns are introduced, update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`

This ensures the documentation remains the single source of truth for the project.
